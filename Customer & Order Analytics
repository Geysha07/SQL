In this SQL, I utilized data from the database BIT_DB to analyze information from multiple tables containing customer and order data.
#1 - How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2 - How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderid) from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in Feburary.BIT_DB

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4 - Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM JanSales
WHERE price IN(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5 - What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity) * price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7 - How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
 
#8 - List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, Sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

#9 - Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2

#10 - How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT sum(quantity) AS quantity, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphones%'
GROUP BY product
